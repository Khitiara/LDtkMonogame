# Entity

Entities are contained inside the level and are returned from the various `GetEntity()`/`GetEntities()` methods, check the api docs for more information.  
Similar to levels entities can have custom fields you handle that data in the same way by creating a custom inherited class from ILDtkEntity.  

If you are using the [Codegen](codegen.md) tool the `Gun_Pickup` file would be created for you automatically.  

```cs
public class Gun_Pickup : ILDtkEntity
{
    public long Uid { get; set; }
    public string Identifier { get; set; }
    public Vector2 Size { get; set; }
    public Vector2 Position { get; set; }
    public Vector2 Pivot { get; set; }
    public Rectangle Tile { get; set; }
    public Color EditorVisualColor { get; set; }
}
```

To load your `Gun_Pickup` you load a level like normal but also pass it your level class

```
Gun_Pickup[] gunPickups = level.GetEntities<Gun_Pickup>();
```

If you have one entity `Player` you could load it 

```
Player playerSpawn = level.GetEntity<Player>();
```
